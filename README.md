Dataset: Richter's Predicition: Modelling Earthquake Damage

URL: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/

Our Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Catboost

Objective: To successfully predict the level of damage grade to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal with the highest level of accuracy. 

# Dataset Preparation:
Check for Null values

Encode categorical data into numeric form

Concatenate the value of the damage grade from 2 datasets into one by mapping it according to its unique identifier, the building ID
